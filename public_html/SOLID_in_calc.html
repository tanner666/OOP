              A class should only have one responsibility or job. This simplifies programs and reduces dependency issues if you have to edit the code.

        <div>
          <p>
              Software components (methods, classes, modules) should be open for extension, not modification. Program components 
              should be designed so that new code can be added on without changing the existing code structure. For example, a base class can 
              be used as a common interface to define subclasses, so that if you wanted to add a new method, you could simply create a new subclass by 
              extending the base class. 
            </p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
                A subclass should be able to substitute for its base (parent) class without breaking the program. This means that any methods 
                overridden in a subclass should still contain the same parameters as its base class. 
              </p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
               Subclasses shouldn't be forced to depend upon interfaces (methods) they don't use. This means that base classes should be 
               as small as possible and only contain methods that all of their subclasses will use. Since a subclass inherits all of the methods 
               from its base class, if the base class contains methods that cannot be used with a subclass, bugs can arise.

          <div>
            <p>
               Both high and low level classes/modules should depend on abstractions, not on other classes/modules. Abstractions also shouldn't 
               depend on details, rather details should depend on abstractions. This means that one class shouldn't know the inner details of another 
               class, much less depend on those details. If one class needs access to data within another class, it must use that other class's methods. 
               In this way, a class can call upon another class's methods, but won't know what those methods actually do. <br>

                Single Responsibility is demonstrated in every class of the Calculator program. The top layer Calculator class is responsible 
                for calling the History class calculation methods and getting the values. The History class is responsible for creating and storing 
                calculation objects in a list, and retrieving results from them. The calculation factory class is responsible for instantiating and setting up 
                all of the calculation objects. The four calculation classes themselves are responsible for performing computations and returning the results. 
                In this way, each class connects to another in a specific way to accomplish a single group of tasks. 
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4><strong>Open/Closed: </strong></h4> 
            </div>

            </div>
            <p>
                The Open/Closed Principle is demonstrated in the calculation factory class, which serves as a base class for the calculation 
                subclasses. Currently there are only four calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) that the Calculator class, 
                can use. If another one needed to be added, say a sqaure root calculation, you could simply create a new square root subclass that would 
                extend the calculation base class, without having to modify the structure of the program. In this way, the O/C Principle is implemented.

            </p>
            <div>
                <h4><strong>Liskov Substitution: </strong></h4> 
            </div>
            <p>
                The Liskov Substitution Principle isn't extremely prevelant in this program, but it can still be seen in the calculation base class. 
                Usually this principle deals with the ability to substitute a subclass, which has overridden methods from the base class, with the bass class, but there is no method 
                overridding in this Calculator program. The fact that the calculation subclasses don't override any of the methods from their base class 
                automatically means that they could be substituted with their base class without breaking the code. In this way the Liskov Substitution Principle is shown.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4><strong>Interface Segregation: </strong></h4> 
            </div>
            <p>
                The Interface Segregation Principle is again demonstrated in the calculation base class. This base class only contains a constructor, 
                a create method, and a convert_value_type method, all of which are utilized by all four of the calculation subclasses. Since all of the 
                calculation subclasses use all of their inherited methods and aren't dependent on any inherited methods they don't use, 
                the Interface Segregation Principle is upheld. 
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4><strong>Dependency Inversion: </strong></h4> 
            </div>
            <p>
                Dependency Inversion is demonstrated by every class in the Calculator program, in that no class can directly access the 
                inner workings of another class. Looking at the top layer Calculator class, the get_result_value() method returns the value 
                of a calculation performed. This method needs to retrieve the value from the list of calculation objects in the History class, but it can't 
                access this data directly. So 
                the get_result_value() method calls upon the History class method: get_last_calculation_value() to retrieve the value from inside the History class. 
                The History class actually only has access to the calculation object stored within the history list and not the value itself, so the get_last_calculation_value() 
                method must call upon the calculation object's get_result() method to retrieve the value from within the calculation class. In this way, 
                none of the classes, high or low level, can directly retrieve data from inside one another, and must instead call upon internal methods.
