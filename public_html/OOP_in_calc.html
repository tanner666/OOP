            1.) Encapsulation: The wrapping of data and methods in one location to put restrictions on what variables and methods can be 
            accessed directly. This prevents the accidental modification of variables/methods by only allowing the programmer to access 
            things on a need to know basis. <br>
            2.) Inheritance: The ability to inherit or assume the properties of a class. This allows for code to be reused across multiple 
            classes, by having each of those classes inherit a parent class that contains the common methods or variables. <br>
            3.) Polymorphism: It literally means the ability to have many forms. It is most commonly seen in method overloading, where a method 
            can be defined multiple times with different input parameters, and in method overriding, where a method in a child class can override 
            the same method from the parent class. <br>
            4.) Abstraction: This deals with abstract classes and the concept of hiding data. Just like classes are blueprints for objects, 
            abstract classes are blueprints for other classes. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are essentially empty methods with just 
            only a declaration, and any classes that inherit the abstract class inherit all of these abstract methods. The abstract methods must  
            then be defined in each subclass. In this way, you can create a common template for classes that need the same methods, but with different 
            implementations. This also provides a fixed structure for the subclasses so that they must implement all the abstract methods.

            The Calculation Factory Class is a base class for the four calculation classes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Although it 
            doesn't contain any abstract methods, The Calculation Factory Class acts similar to an abstract class, in that it acts as a blueprint for 
            the 4 calculation classes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), providing methods those classes all inherit. 
            Each calculation class, like the addition class shown above, inherits the methods of the Calculation Factory Class, allowing all 
            4 of them to have the same methods, but for the methods to only be defined at one point in the program. The base class allows for code 
            reusability, while also hiding what the each of its methods do from the individual calculation classes. So the 4 calculation classes can 
            use the methods from the base class, but don't know what they do. Encapsulation is also demonstrated here, in the 4 calculation classes. Take 
            the addition class for example. Although the addition class inherits the Calculation Factory Class's methods, it also has its own unique 
            get_result() method. The addition class encapsulates this method, as well as the inherited ones. This get_result() method makes the class private from its base class and all 
            other classes in the program, meaning that no other class can access the addition class's state directly, but only through its unique get_result() method.
            Finally, polymorphism is also demonstrated in the 4 calculation classes in their different get_result() methods. Polymorphism refers to having 
            many forms, and the get_result() method takes on a different form with the same name in each of the 4 calculation classes.
