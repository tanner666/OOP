        </div>
        <div>
          OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. It is a software design model that structures a program around objects or data.

        <div class="d-sm-flex align-items-md-center">
          <h2 class="py-2"><strong>Four Principles of OOP</strong></h2>          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4 class="py-2"><strong>1.) Encapsulation: </strong></h4> 
          <p>
            The wrapping of data and methods in one location to put restrictions on what variables and methods can be 
            accessed directly. This prevents the accidental modification of variables/methods by only allowing the programmer to access 
            things on a need to know basis. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="py-2"><strong>2.) Inheritance: </strong></h4>
          <p>
            The ability to inherit or assume the properties of a class. This allows for code to be reused across multiple 
            classes, by having each of those classes inherit a parent class that contains the common methods or variables.
          </p>
          <h4 class="py-2"><strong>3.) Polymorphism: </strong></h4>  
          <p>
            It literally means the ability to have many forms. It is most commonly seen in method overloading, where a method 
            can be defined multiple times with different input parameters, and in method overriding, where a method in a child class can override 
            the same method from the parent class.
          </p>  
          <h4 class="py-2"><strong>4.) Abstraction: </strong></h4>
          <p>
            This deals with abstract classes and the concept of hiding data. Just like classes are blueprints for objects, 
            abstract classes are blueprints for other classes. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are essentially empty methods with just 
            only a declaration, and any classes that inherit the abstract class inherit all of these abstract methods. The abstract methods must  
            then be defined in each subclass. In this way, you can create a common template for classes that need the same methods, but with different 
            implementations. This also provides a fixed structure for the subclasses so that they must implement all the abstract methods.

          <p>
              1/2.) Abstraction and Interitance: The Calculation Factory Class is a base class for the four calculation classes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Although it 
              doesn't contain any abstract methods, The Calculation Factory Class acts similar to an abstract class in that it acts as a blueprint for 
              the four calculation classes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), providing methods those classes all inherit. 
              Each calculation class, inherits the methods of the Calculation Factory Class, allowing all 
              four of them to have the same methods, but for the methods to only be defined at one point in the program. The base class allows for code 
              reusability, while also hiding what the each of its methods do from the individual calculation classes. So the 4 calculation classes can 
              use the methods from the base class, but don't know what they do. <br>
              3.) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is also demonstrated here in the four calculation classes. Take 
              the addition class for example. The addition class encapsulates (or houses) its unique get_result() method, as well as the inherited ones. 
              Information within the addition class cannot be accessed directly from outside of the class, but can only be accessed through these 
              methods, specifically the get_result() method. <br>
              4.) Polymorphism: Finally, polymorphism is also demonstrated in the four calculation classes in their different get_result() methods. Polymorphism refers to having 
              many forms, and the get_result() method takes on a different form with the same name in each of the four calculation classes. The point of this is to organize the program, 
              so that when any of the four calculation classes are instantiated, the result will always be returned through a method of the same name.
