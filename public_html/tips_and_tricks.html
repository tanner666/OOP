        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Simply put, Pylint is a tool that tests the quality or style of a Python program according to PEP 8 standards (styling standards). 
            Linting can be performed on a program via the command line, using "pylint program.py", or directly in an IDE by importing pylint. 
            For larger projects with mutliple testing tools, pylint will often be included in a requirements.py file. 
            Now onto styling tips for Pylint. First, always include docstrings in your classes. You will need one module docstring as the first 
            line of every python file, a class docstring following a class header, and a method/function docstring after every method/function 
            header. Second, line spacing is important. There should be two lines between an import statement and a class header, two lines between 
            instance methods, one line between static methods, and one empty trailing line left at the end of every python file. Third, class names
            should be in CamelCase and not include underscores. Fourth, always make sure all methods or variables are being used. Any unused 
            statements will throw a pylint error.
            One last helpful tip is that specific pylint errors can be ignored using '# pylint: disable=error_name'.

          <ul>
            <li>
                <kbd>Class</kbd>: Classes act as blueprints for objects, housing constructors, methods, and variables. 
              </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Class method</kbd>: Class methods are methods bound to a class (not an object). They take a class parameter, which allows them to 
                access and modify the state of the class. These are commonly used to create factory methods, which essentially create class 
                objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Constructor</kbd>: Constructors are a part of classes used to initialize variables and specify object parameters. 
                They are used outside the class to instatiate objects. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Design Patterns</kbd>: Design Patterns are a crucial part of software development, as they allow programs to be readable 
                and efficient. They refer to the best practices used in writing software, or rather, templates for how to solve problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Facade</kbd>: Facade referes to a shell or an outer layer that houses and connects all the inner layers. It is a design pattern 
                that allows one outer class or method to connect all the inner classes and methods. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>Factory</kbd>: Factory methods are design patterns that are used to create class objects. They are used so that all of the class 
              objects are instantiated in the same place.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Fixture</kbd>: Fixtures are used in testing files to initialize test functions, so that the tests can run reliably and consitently.
              </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>Instantiation</kbd>: Instantiation refers to the creation of a class object, where all the methods and variables in the class 
              are inherited by the object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Methods</kbd>: Methods (or functions) are reusable chunks of code created to fulfill specific tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Method Signature</kbd>: Method, or function, signatures specify the parameters of a method.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Namespace</kbd>: A Namespace is essentially a dictionary that contains a collection of names and the objects those names refer to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>Object</kbd>: An object is an instance of a class, or more generally, a value stored in memory.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Property</kbd>: Properties refer to getter and setter methods, which are built into languages such as Python, that allow for 
                accessing and manipulating data. Properties can also refer to the characteristics of methods or classes or variables, such as static 
                or instance. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Static</kbd>: Static methods are methods bound to a class. Unlike class methods, however, they do not take a class parameter, meaning 
                that they cannot access or modify the class state. Static variables are class variables that exist only in a single copy. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Type cast</kbd>: Casting refers to the conversion of a variable from one type to another. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Type hint</kbd>: Type hinting refers to indicating the type of a value in Python code.
            </li>
            <li>
                <kbd>Unit Test</kbd>: Unit testing refers to the testing of code in the development process to identify bugs and errors early on. Unit 
                Tests usually consist of test methods to test if all methods in a program produce the desired result.
            </li>
