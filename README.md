This website was created for a school project. The objective of the site is to provide users with a tutorial on building and deploying a website on Azure Cloud with Docker using nothing more than the command line. Tutorial pages for pre-requisite knowledge is provided as well.

Azure must have updated something recently bc my original links no longer work.
Here is the new working link (as of 12/15/21)
